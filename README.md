# ML_Projects.

I have performed the following machine learning algorithms and derived conclusions on Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset which is available on Kaggle.
1) T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(T-SNE) for visualizing the data 
2) K-Nearest Neighbours
3) Naive Bayes
4) Logistic Regression
5) Support Vector Machines(SVM)
6) Decision Trees
7) Random Forests



CNN_MNIST
: In this project, I tried out different models with CNN layers and experimented with number of layers on MNIST data.
Included error plots for visual description
.Finally, compared all the models in a tabular format


MLP(Using Dropouts and Batch Normalization):
